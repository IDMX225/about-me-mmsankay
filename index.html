    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <div>

        <p>Hi everyone. I'm student Marian Sankay from West Africa. I 
            relocated to the US some years ago.Was working on my BSC in Civil Engineering
            but didn't complete due to my relocation. When I came to the US, it was 
            challenging in a sense starting a new life over. I had to work and save some cash because
             I wanted to continual my education journey. After some years I was able to enroll at the 
             Excess community college in New Jersey. When I enter I decided to start from stratch so I 
             could better understand the learning system well here because learning back home is totally different.
             At some point it was challenging because I had to adjust to a new environment of learning but 
            as time when bye I was able to get on track and came out with flying colors. I was even getting 
            few founds that help with my tuations and books process. While there I was able to complete most of my pre
             courses.Later I had to move to another state. When I stettle I decided to go back to school that is how
             I am here now at RVCC community collage. When I came at this college , I brought my transcrip but all those 
             courses  I completed it was one that not accepted. It was frustrating but that did not stop me. I ended changing 
             my program to Information system and Tecnology. Since then , it been off and on semester due to cash. I am glad 
             I am learning and have learned alot through. I have completed few progromming courses and this semester I decided to 
             take Wed Development which is part of my courses. It was sometime ruff along the way because it was an online class.
             where in you have to teach yourself and you should have some knowledge on the course. Mine was not like that I am ,and 
              was Currently learning everything. As semester when bye I started being proud of myself cause I had no idea at first 
              how to start.This have motivate me to do and work on developing lot in the future and I wish to collaborate with you all 
               My 2025 goals is to learn more about web. My hobbies I love singing, dancing, reading, cooking and creating inspiration </p>
